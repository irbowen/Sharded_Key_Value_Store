Demo 1 (linearizability)
0. python make script
1. 5 replicas, 1 shard
2. put hash good
3. pause id 2
4. put hash bad
5. kill id 0 and 1
6. Unpause
7. get hash

Demo 2 (killing + adding shard + view changes)
1. 3 replicas, 2 shards
2. bunch of puts
3. kill first replica of all shards
4. add shard
5. view changes happen

Demo 3 (Interactive clients + master processing multiple requests)
1. Two shards, 5 replicas each
2. Two interactive clients
3. puts that go in both shards
4. pause entire shard 2
5. Client 2 doesn't get responses to shard 2
6. But client 1 gets response from shard 1

Demo 4 (Unordered map verification)
1. Three shards, 5 replicas, one shard in master_configs
2. ./run.sh with kv_client_auto.cc
