# A Distributed, Sharded Key-Value Store
## Written in C++, backed by paxos

Isaac Bowen(irbowen) & Pranav Ramarao(pranavr)

Our paxos implmentation is written in c++14. You can git clone the repo, cd in the dir, and type `make`.
This will build the binares for the key-value/paxos replicas and the binares for many clients that can be used for testing.
